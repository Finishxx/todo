The project was generated using [create-vue](https://github.com/vuejs/create-vue).

Took **enormous** inspiration (the book-wide project was also a TODO app) from the
book [Vue.js 3 Design Patterns and Best Practices](https://www.amazon.com/Vue-js-Design-Patterns-Best-Practices/dp/1803238070).

The used styling is [w3.css](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/) and [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).
