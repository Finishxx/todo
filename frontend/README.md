# TODO frontend

Rudimentary Typescript + Vue.js 3 frontend for Spring Boot backend made as a
part of interview preparation for a developer job.

## Get started

Run the dev server and open the site in your browser. The application requires a
backend server to be running to function properly.

```bash
$ npm run dev
...
  âžœ  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
...
```

## Component hierarchy

- MainHeader
- Todo
    - TodoSummary: Counts how many tasks there are for each status
    - TodoFilter
    - TodoEntryList: Lists entries and hosts CRUD buttons
    - Modal
        - TodoConfirmDeleteModal
        - TodoEditModal
- MainFooter

## Known issues

- No thought was given to mobile users or responsiveness in general
- The application is single page, but not in the sense of SPA needing Vue
  Router.
- The styling and functionality are quite basic
