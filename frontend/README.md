# TODO frontend

## Component hierarchy

- Header
- Todo
  - TodoSummary
  - TodoFilter
  - TodoEntryList
- Footer

## Known issues

No thought was given to mobile users.

In multiple simultaneous user scenarios inconsistencies may surface
ungracefully.

The application is single page, but not in the sense of SPA using Vue Router.

## Attributions

The project was generated using
[create-vue](https://github.com/vuejs/create-vue).

Took **enormous** inspiration (the book-wide project was also a TODO app) from
the book
[Vue.js 3 Design Patterns and Best Practices](https://www.amazon.com/Vue-js-Design-Patterns-Best-Practices/dp/1803238070).

The used styling is [w3.css](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/) and
[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).
