# Developer interview preparation

Decided to join the backend and frontend repos for simplicity's sake, although
in retrospect it did not simplify things much and made commit history a mess.

Please do refer further to appropriate `README.md` files in `backend` and
`frontend` folders.

## Get started

A Docker Compose file is provided for ease of use. Admittedly the Docker files
were written largely by AI.

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

The backend REST API should then be available to explore
at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html and the frontend should be
available at http://localhost:5173/.

Otherwise, it is possible to run both the frontend and backend locally.
